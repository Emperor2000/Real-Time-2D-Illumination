## Overview

Lighting is a key element in game design, creating atmosphere and enhancing the player's experience. This document details a 2D lighting system suitable for small- to medium-scale projects. The system prioritizes adaptability and ease of replication, making it accessible for game developers.

---

## Features

The system described in this document includes:
- **Dynamic Point Lights**: Adjustable intensity and range.
- **Cast Shadows**: Realistic shadows calculated dynamically.
- **Rim Lighting**: Highlights the edges of objects illuminated by nearby light sources.
- A mathematical framework and implementation guide to help developers integrate the system into their own projects.

---

## Document Contents

The document includes:
- **Mathematical Framework**: Core principles for light attenuation, shadow casting, and rim lighting.
- **Implementation Details**: Code snippets and shader logic for GameMaker.
- **Results and Visuals**: Demonstrations of the systemâ€™s features using sample scenes.
- **Limitations and Future Work**: Discussion on current constraints and potential areas for improvement.
